## Why Stochastic Thinking Matters

When AI assistants make decisions - whether writing code, solving problems, or suggesting improvements - they often fall into patterns of "local thinking", similar to how we might get stuck trying the same approach repeatedly despite poor results. This is like being trapped in a valley when there's a better solution on the next mountain over, but you can't see it from where you are.

This server introduces advanced decision-making strategies that help break out of these local patterns:
- Instead of just looking at the immediate next step (like basic Markov chains do), these algorithms can look multiple steps ahead and consider many possible futures
- Rather than always picking the most obvious solution, they can strategically explore alternative approaches that might initially seem suboptimal
- When faced with uncertainty, they can balance the need to exploit known good solutions with the potential benefit of exploring new ones

Think of it as giving your AI assistant a broader perspective - instead of just choosing the next best immediate action, it can now consider "What if I tried something completely different?" or "What might happen several steps down this path?"

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides stochastic algorithms and probabilistic decision-making capabilities, extending the sequential thinking server with advanced mathematical models.
