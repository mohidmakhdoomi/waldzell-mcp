# TypeStyle Server Updates

## Version 0.1.0 Changes

### 1. Testing Framework Implementation

Added a comprehensive testing framework for the TypeStyle server:

- **Test Harness**: Created `src/test/test-harness.ts` with a robust framework for testing all style categories
  - Includes mock search service to test without external MCP dependencies
  - Tests all categories with and without grounding
  - Uses sample TypeScript code with intentional style issues
  - Validates detection of style violations in all categories

- **Integration Tests**: Added `src/test/integration-test.ts` for testing with real external MCP servers
  - Tests connections to Perplexity and/or Exa MCP servers
  - Demonstrates usage in different modes (full analysis, category-specific, style questions)

- **Category Mapping**: Implemented mapping between test categories and style categories
  - Ensures test cases properly exercise the correct server functionality

- **Documentation**: Added `src/test/README.md` with detailed information about the test suite
  - Explains how to run tests, add new test cases, and interpret results

### 2. NPM Scripts

Added dedicated npm scripts for testing:

- `npm run test`: Run the test harness with mock search services
- `npm run test:watch`: Build and run tests in a single command
- `npm run test:integration`: Run integration tests with real MCP servers

### 3. Documentation Updates

Enhanced documentation in main README.md:

- Added Testing section with instructions for running tests
- Clarified test harness capabilities and usage
- Updated integration testing instructions with environment variable setup

### 4. Directory Structure

Enhanced project organization:

- Added `/src/test/` directory for test-related files
- Organized test samples and mock responses

### 5. Version Update

Updated version from 0.0.1 to 0.1.0 to reflect significant new testing capabilities.

## Version 0.1.1 Changes

### 1. Exa Integration

Added direct integration with Exa search through an MCP server:

- **MCP Configuration**: Created `typestyle_mcp_config.ts` to centralize MCP server configuration
  - Includes Exa API key configuration
  - Makes it simpler to manage external MCP dependencies

- **Enhanced Integration Tests**: Updated integration testing to use Exa MCP server
  - Added automatic spawning of Exa MCP server during tests
  - Improved error handling and process management
  - Simplified testing workflow

- **New Test Script**: Added `npm run test:exa` for easy integration testing with Exa
  - Automatically installs and configures the Exa MCP server
  - Seamless testing experience without manual setup

### 2. Documentation Updates

Enhanced documentation for Exa integration:

- **Updated README**: Added comprehensive Exa integration instructions
  - Improved Claude Desktop configuration examples
  - Added configuration examples with Exa MCP server
  - New simplified testing procedure with Exa

- **Environment Configuration**: Added clearer instructions for setting up environment variables
  - Includes both manual approach and simplified config-based approach
  - Docker deployment with Exa integration

### 3. Development Dependencies

- Added `exa-mcp-server` as a development dependency
- Improved scripts and configuration for easier developer experience

## Next Steps

1. **Performance testing**: Add benchmarks for different code sizes
2. **More test cases**: Add more comprehensive test cases for each style category
3. **Code formatting**: Implement actual code formatting functionality (currently a placeholder)
4. **Deployment**: Prepare for Smithery deployment with proper environment configuration
5. **API Integration**: Add support for additional search APIs and services
